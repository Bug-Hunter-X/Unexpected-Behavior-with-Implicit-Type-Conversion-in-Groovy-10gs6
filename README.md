This example demonstrates a subtle bug in Groovy related to implicit type conversion.  The `myMethod` function expects a String argument. While it handles null and empty strings correctly, passing a list throws an exception because Groovy attempts to implicitly convert the list to a String which fails. The solution shows how to explicitly handle the type mismatch to make your code more robust.
